3000+ Applications. 15 Interviews. Countless Rejections. 1 Offer That Changed Everything.

There were nights I couldn’t sleep…
Mornings I woke up with hope, only to end the day in heartbreak.

I applied to over 3000 companies— each application a silent scream of “give me a chance.”
Each rejection? It chipped away a little more at my confidence.

I rewrote my resume at least 10 times — every revision wasn’t just formatting, it was redefining my identity. Trying again and again to prove that I was worth something, that I had something real to offer.

Out of those 3000+, I received around 25 interview calls.
15 interviews were scheduled, and that’s where the real rollercoaster began.

Rejected 10 times in the first round — before even getting to tell my story.
Rejected 3 times after the second round — close, but still not enough.
Once, I made it all the way to the final round— my heart said, “this is it…”
But life said, “not yet.”

Every "We regret to inform you..." hit like a punch in the gut.
I felt invisible. Forgotten. Exhausted.
But even in the silence… even when doubt screamed louder than hope…

I didn’t quit.

There was this voice inside me that whispered —
"You didn’t come this far, just to come this far."

So I kept showing up.
Even when I felt broken.
Even when every door closed.
Even when all I had left was the attitude of never giving up.

And then… it happened.
One YES.
One offer that made every “no” worth it.

I’m now beyond in gratitude to share that I’ve joined Persistent Systems as a DevOps Engineer.

That offer wasn’t just a job — it was the culmination of pain, patience, persistence, and pure resilience.
It was a sign that the universe rewards those who refuse to give up.


🙏 I want to express my heartfelt gratitude to some of the incredible people who inspired and guided me on this journey:

Abhishek Veeramalla, Shubham Londhe, Saikiran Pinapathruni, and Piyush sachdeva —

Thank you for your content, your guidance, your mentorship, and for showing that the DevOps path is possible.
Your impact on my journey has been real, deep, and unforgettable.

To anyone out there still applying, still hoping, still hurting — I see you.
Your struggle isn’t for nothing.
You are not being rejected — you are being refined.

Your “yes” is coming. And when it does… it will feel like everything you ever dreamed of.

Please don’t stop.
Dreams don’t work unless you refuse to quit.

"Your dreams are waiting for you — but only if you keep walking toward them, no matter how many doors close on the way."

— A DevOps Engineer who refused to give up.
