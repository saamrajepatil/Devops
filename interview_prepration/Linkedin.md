 But the truth is for 2–3 years of experience, the market is tough.
So instead of commenting "Interested," follow these genuine professionals who consistently share real Cloud & DevOps job opportunities:

1. Bharath Kumar Reddy
→ What does he do?
 He comments like "Great opportunity here" , "Exciting opportunity." He reposts job openings shared by the HRs and likes the posts. So follow him, check his activity, and apply. You'll often find HR email IDs directly there.

2. Sandeep Das
→ What does he do?
 He posts job openings and adds the link in the comment section itself. So don’t comment "I’m interested" instead, apply using the link. The links he shares are genuine and that directly redirects to the company’s website.

3. Pranav Jambare
→ What does he do?
 He shares the job openings, not just in Cloud and DevOps but across various fields. He clearly mentions in his posts that he is not a recruiter, so don’t comment "I’m interested" , instead, draft a proper email and apply.
