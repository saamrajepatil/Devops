I applied to 100 jobs daily and got 10 job offers but failed in 20 companies

I started my job search in the month of August and initially I faced lot of challenges to get the calls from the recruiters.

I slowly started understanding that applying 10-20 jobs daily is not helping me to crack my dream companies.

so I created my profile on platforms like LinkedIn, Naukri, Instahyre, foundit and many other such platforms as I got it on my way while searching on Google.

My daily routine in my job search time

Wake up early in the morning at 6 AM Fresh up

Do excercise by 7 AM to make sure I am fit during the stress time

8:30 AM to 9:30 AM Aplply jobs in portals

30 Jobs on Linkedin

40 Jobs on Naukri

20-30 Jobs on Instahyre

10-20 Jobs on Foundit

And so on in Google for other websites

9:30-11:30 AM Breakfast and Office hours

11:30 AM-10 PM I make sure I take as many interviews as possible

(Meanwhile though few hours were spent for office)
