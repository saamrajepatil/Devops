### 🔶 1. Waterfall Model

#### ▶ Concept:

* A traditional, sequential software development model.
* Each phase must be completed before moving to the next.
* Phases: Requirements → Design → Development → Testing → Deployment → Maintenance

#### ▶ Real-Life Example:

* Building a house: You finalize the blueprint, complete construction, and then do interior work.

#### ▶ When to Use:

* Projects with clearly defined requirements.
* Minimal changes expected during development.

#### ▶ Pros:

* Easy to manage.
* Documentation is clear.
* Good for small projects.

#### ▶ Cons:

* Inflexible to changes.
* Late discovery of bugs.
* Risky if the client needs change.

### 🔷 2. Agile Model

#### ▶ Concept:

* Iterative and incremental development.
* Flexible and adaptive to change.
* Emphasizes collaboration, customer feedback, and small rapid releases.

#### ▶ Real-Life Example:

* Developing a mobile app in versions. Release a minimum version, gather feedback, and improve.

#### ▶ Agile Manifesto:

* Individuals & interactions over processes & tools.
* Working software over comprehensive documentation.
* Customer collaboration over contract negotiation.
* Responding to change over following a plan.

#### ▶ Pros:

* Flexible to changes.
* Frequent delivery of working software.
* Better customer satisfaction.

#### ▶ Cons:

* Requires high customer involvement.
* Difficult to predict cost & time in large projects.

### 🌀 3. Scrum Framework (Agile methodology)

#### ▶ Scrum Roles:

* **Product Owner**: Manages product backlog, defines requirements.
* **Scrum Master**: Ensures process is followed, removes blockers.
* **Development Team**: Builds the product.

#### ▶ Scrum Events:

* **Sprint Planning**: Decide what to build in this sprint.
* **Daily Standup**: 15-min sync on progress & blockers.
* **Sprint Review**: Demo work to stakeholders.
* **Sprint Retrospective**: Review process & improve.

#### ▶ Scrum Artifacts:

* **Product Backlog**: List of all desired work.
* **Sprint Backlog**: Tasks selected for a sprint.
* **Increment**: Working product delivered.

#### ▶ Example:

> An online food delivery app team uses 2-week sprints. In one sprint, they build a "Track Order" feature.

---

### 🛠 4. Jira (Agile Tool)

#### ▶ Purpose:

* Manage Agile projects using boards.
* Create, assign, and track user stories/tasks.

#### ▶ Key Features:

* Scrum & Kanban boards
* Burndown charts & velocity
* Sprint planning
* Backlog management

#### ▶ Real-World Example:

> Team working on a banking website creates user stories in Jira like "Create Login Page" or "Set up SSL" and moves them across the board as they complete stages.

#### ▶ Real-Time Demo Plan: 2 Sprints for an E-Commerce Application

**Team Members:** Developer(s), QA, DevOps, Database Admin

**Environment Setup:** DEV, QA, UAT, PROD

---

### 🚀 Sprint 1: 15 Days

**Goal:** Build and deploy core user registration and product catalog APIs with basic Dev environment setup.

**User Stories/Tasks:**

* \[Dev] Create REST APIs for user registration and login (8 pts)
* \[Dev] Build product catalog API with search and filter (13 pts)
* \[DB] Design and create schema for users and products (5 pts)
* \[QA] Write test cases for user and catalog APIs (3 pts)
* \[QA] Perform functional testing on DEV environment (5 pts)
* \[DevOps] Provision DEV environment using Terraform (5 pts)
* \[DevOps] Configure Jenkins for CI pipeline and trigger (5 pts)
* \[DevOps] Enable basic monitoring on DEV environment (3 pts)

---

### 🚀 Sprint 2: 15 Days

**Goal:** Complete shopping cart, initial QA/UAT deployment, and prepare for staging.

**User Stories/Tasks:**

* \[Dev] Implement shopping cart functionality (8 pts)
* \[Dev] Add integration with payment gateway (13 pts)
* \[DB] Add schema changes for cart and transactions (3 pts)
* \[QA] Test end-to-end shopping flow on QA (8 pts)
* \[DevOps] Setup QA and UAT environments (5 pts)
* \[DevOps] Build and deploy via CI/CD on QA/UAT (5 pts)
* \[QA] Perform regression and cross-browser testing (5 pts)
* \[DevOps] Enable UAT logging/alerts for performance metrics (2 pts)

---

### 📊 Sample Sprint Metrics:

* Velocity: \~40–45 points per sprint
* Review: Demo user registration and cart checkout by end of Sprint 2

---

### 📚 5. ITIL (IT Infrastructure Library)

#### ▶ Concept:

* Framework for managing IT services.
* Aligns IT with business needs.

#### ▶ ITIL Lifecycle Stages:

1. **Service Strategy**: Define services that add value.
2. **Service Design**: Design architecture, SLAs, policies.
3. **Service Transition**: Change, release, deployment.
4. **Service Operation**: Incident management, service desk.
5. **Continual Service Improvement**: Analyze metrics, improve services.

#### ▶ Example:

> An IT support team handles incidents (e.g., login failure) and change requests (e.g., patch upgrade) using ITIL best practices.

#### ▶ Key ITIL Processes:

* **Incident Management**: Restore service quickly.
* **Change Management**: Controlled changes.
* **Problem Management**: Root cause analysis.
* **Configuration Management**: Maintain CMDB.

---

### ✅ Real-Life Correlation Scenario:

> A product team in a fintech company uses **Scrum** with **Jira** to plan sprints and deliver features. All deployments are managed using **ITIL** processes for change control and incident management. Older legacy systems are still managed with the **Waterfall model** for stability.
