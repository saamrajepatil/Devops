Step by step guide to Grab DevOps/SRE.


Getting a DevOps or Site Reliability Engineering (SRE) internship while in college requires a mix of technical preparation, strategic application, and sometimes a bit of persistence. Here's a structured guide to help you break into these roles:

1. Understand What DevOps/SRE Interns Do

Before applying, understand the core responsibilities: DevOps person may work on CI/CD pipelines, infrastructure automation (e.g., with Terraform, Ansible), container orchestration (e.g., Kubernetes), cloud platforms (AWS, GCP, Azure), and monitoring tools.
SRE person focus on reliability, system performance, incident response, automation, monitoring, and capacity planning.

2. Learn the Right Skills

Essentials to Know: Area Tools & Concepts OS & Networking Linux, Bash scripting, networking basics (DNS, HTTP, etc.) Programming Python, Go, or Shell scripting Version Control Git CI/CD Jenkins, GitHub Actions, GitLab CI Containerization Docker, Kubernetes Infrastructure as Code Terraform, Ansible, Pulumi Cloud Platforms AWS, GCP, Azure Monitoring/Logging Prometheus, Grafana, ELK stack, Datadog You don’t need to master all of them — pick a few and build real projects.

3. Build Projects to Show Your Skills

CI/CD pipeline for a sample app using Jenkins .
Set up a Dockerized Flask app deployed to AWS EC2
Create a Kubernetes cluster on AWS and deploy a microservice
Write Terraform scripts to deploy infrastructure on AWS
Host your work on GitHub with detailed READMEs.

4. Craft a Focused Resume

Make a one-page resume that highlights:
Technical projects (esp. DevOps-focused)
Relevant coursework (e.g., OS, Distributed Systems, Cloud Computing)
Tools you’ve worked with
Internships or part-time roles (even if not SRE-related)

5. Start Applying Early

Startups often hire generalists, so apply even if they don’t list “DevOps Intern.”
Big Tech (Google, Meta, Amazon, etc.) sometimes offer SRE-specific internships.
Apply through:
LinkedIn
AngelList (now Wellfound)
Company career pages
University job boards
Tech Twitter or GitHub discussions

6. Network and Get Referrals

Reach out to DevOps/SRE professionals on LinkedIn:
Be polite, specific, and ask for advice (not a job right away).
Join communities:
r/devops, r/SRE on Reddit
Discord servers (like SRE DevOps or Tech Career Growth)
DevOps-focused Slack communities

7. Prepare for Interviews

Technical rounds: scripting, cloud basics, system design (basic), monitoring/logging.
Behavioral: Show interest in automation, reliability, and infrastructure.
Resources:
Leetcode (for basic scripting/data structure questions)
System design (YouTube, ByteByteGo, etc.)
Practice using mock interview platforms (Pramp, Interviewing.io)
